For you to be able to run it on Windows, please follow steps below:

I will not mention versions as they may differ with OS.
Download Anaconda, I reccomend downloading the latest version available then install it. I forgot but I think having Anaconda makes it easy to have jupyter installed. Install matplotlib, matplotlib-inline, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, seaborn. Also install statsmodels

I don't know what I forgot but we will see with errors you may have if there is something missing
